# Library Control System (C)
### A project I made during my second semester at DIT HUA (2025)

This is a simple Library Management System implemented in C. It uses **doubly linked lists** to manage books, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal in both directions.

## Features

- Add new books to the library
- Remove books by ID or title
- Search for books
- Display all books in forward or reverse order
- Update book information

## Technologies Used

- C programming language
- Doubly linked list data structure
- Console-based interface
